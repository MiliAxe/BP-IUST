## What does this document provide?

This document provides basic guidelines that can be referred to when holding
a C programming language course. I will be referring to this document
while I am a Head Teaching Assistant at my University.

## What are we trying to achieve at the end of the course?

At the end of the course students should:

- have no problem coding in C
- not be running away from C
- know the importance of C
- know how memory works in the C
- have no problem working with the tools available
- have no problem working with the external libraries
  available

## What are some common challenges that students face?

Mainly, students who have not coded in languages like C before face the
following challenges understanding:

- pointers
- memory allocation
- how manual memory management works
- moving to compiling and running code from the terminal rather
  than using an IDE

## What are some pitfalls some courses in our University face?

are usually running away from C, usually because the courses made

I personally have experienced a lot of frustration in the following:

- Ineffective, boring simple I/O programs as homework
- No real-world applications of the language

## How to structure the course?

The course has the following structures:
