## What is a Function Declaration in C?

A **function declaration** in C:

- Tells the compiler about the function's return type, name, and parameters before the function is used.
- Provides a prototype to the compiler so it knows how to call the function.

Example:

```c
int add(int a, int b);
```

---

## Function Declaration vs. Function Definition

### Function Declaration (Prototype):

- Specifies the function signature.
- Declares return type, name, and parameters.
- Does not contain the actual body of the function.

Example:

```c
int add(int a, int b); // Declaration
```

### Function Definition:

- Contains the actual implementation of the function.

Example:

```c
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b; // Definition
}
```

---

## How is a Function Declaration Different from Other Languages?

In **C**, function declarations are necessary before you use a function:

- In C, a declaration tells the compiler the function's signature.
- In other languages like **Python** or **JavaScript**, function declarations are often implicit (you define the function and use it without needing a separate declaration).

Example in JavaScript:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

---

## Why is Function Declaration Used in C?

### Key Reasons:

1. **Forward Declaration**:

   - Allows functions to be used before their definitions in code.
   - Supports better code organization by placing function declarations in headers.

2. **Type Safety**:

   - Ensures the correct number and types of parameters are passed to the function.

3. **Modular Programming**:
   - Facilitates splitting code into separate files (headers and source files).

---

## What are Header Files?

Header files in C are files with a `.h` extension that contain declarations for:

- Functions
- Macros
- Constants
- Data types
- Variables

---

## Why Do We Need Header Files?

Header files allow us to:

- Share declarations across multiple source files.
- Organize our codebase better.
- Enable code reuse by defining libraries of functions and constants.

---

## Common Header Files in the Standard Library

Some examples of standard header files are:

- `stdio.h`: For input/output functions.
- `stdlib.h`: For memory allocation, random numbers, etc.
- `math.h`: For mathematical functions.
- `string.h`: For string manipulation.

---

## Anatomy of a Header File

A typical header file contains:

- **Include guards** to prevent multiple inclusions.
- Declarations of functions, macros, and variables.
- Necessary comments or documentation.

Example:

```c
#ifndef MY_HEADER_H
#define MY_HEADER_H

void sayHello();
#define PI 3.14159

#endif // MY_HEADER_H
```

---

## The Role of Include Guards

**Include guards** prevent the same header file from being included more than once in a single compilation unit.

Without them, you might face **redefinition errors**.

Illustration:

```c
// my_header.h
#ifndef MY_HEADER_H
#define MY_HEADER_H
int x;
#endif
```

---

## Behind the Scenes: How `#include` Works

When you write:

```c
#include "my_header.h"
```

The preprocessor:

1. Locates the header file.
2. Replaces the `#include` directive with the full content of `my_header.h`.

---

## Preprocessor Magic: Visualizing Inclusion

Program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "my_header.h"

int main() {
    printf("Value of x: %d\n", x);
    return 0;
}
```

---

Preprocessed Code:

```c
// stdio.h contents
int printf(const char*, ...);

// my_header.h contents
int x;

int main() {
    printf("Value of x: %d\n", x);
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Types of Header Files

- **Standard Header Files**:

  - Provided by the C library.
  - e.g., `<stdio.h>`, `<math.h>`

- **Custom Header Files**:
  - Created by programmers.
  - Must be included with `" "`, not `< >`.

---

## Standard vs. Custom Header Files

| Feature        | Standard (`<stdio.h>`)  | Custom (`"my_header.h"`) |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Location       | Predefined system paths | Project-specific paths   |
| Included Using | `<header.h>`            | `"header.h"`             |

---

## Example: Custom Header File

**my_math.h**:

```c
#ifndef MY_MATH_H
#define MY_MATH_H

int add(int a, int b);
int subtract(int a, int b);

#endif
```

**main.c**:

```c
#include "my_math.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Sum: %d\n", add(3, 4));
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Compilation Process with Header Files

### How the compiler handles `#include`:

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Replaces `#include` directives with header file content.
2. **Compilation**:
   - Translates source code into object code.
3. **Linking**:
   - Combines object files and resolves dependencies.

---

## Header File Best Practices

- Always use **include guards** or `#pragma once`.
- Keep function **definitions** out of header files.
- Document your header files for easier understanding.
- Avoid including unnecessary headers.

---

## Common Errors with Header Files

1. **Missing Include Guards**:

   - Leads to redefinition errors.

2. **Circular Inclusion**:

   - A includes B, B includes A → infinite loop.

3. **Function Definitions in Headers**:
   - Leads to multiple definition errors.

---

## Debugging Header File Issues

- Use the `gcc -E` flag to inspect preprocessed output.
  ```bash
  gcc -E main.c
  ```
- Avoid circular includes by carefully structuring your dependencies.

---

## A Fun Fact: Why `.h`?

The `.h` extension stands for **header**. It’s a convention inherited from the early days of C, when modular programming became essential.

---

## Summary

1. Header files define reusable components for your programs.
2. Use `#include` to bring in their functionality.
3. Include guards and best practices ensure error-free usage.
4. Mastering header files is key to writing maintainable C code.

---

## Small Exercise

1. Create a header file called `geometry.h` with the following declarations:
   - A constant `PI = 3.14159`.
   - A function prototype for `float area_circle(float radius);`
2. Write a `main.c` to calculate the area of a circle using this header file.
