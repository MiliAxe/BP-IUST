# How is this semester is going to be different?

## What is the problem?

Students...

- End up **hating C** after taking this course.
- Don't learn **creating functional** programs.
  (Just a bunch of scanf/printf questions)
- Don't learn how to debug their code properly.
- Don't even adhere to **basic** clean code principles.
- Don't learn how to **read** and **understand** documentations.

## How are homeworks going to be different?

- **Functional** programs: Homework won't be limited to scanf/printf
  questions. Although they are important, they are not the only thing.
  We might be forced to have some of them in the beginning, but we will
  move on to more interesting ones. (i.e. Creating useful CLI tools)


## How are homeworks going to be different?

- **Debugging**: students will be challenged to debug their code by the
  challenges we provide. Students will be encouraged to use proper debugging
  tools and techniques to find the bugs in their code rather than just using
  printf statements.

## How are homeworks going to be different?

- **Clean code**: Students will be forced to adhere to basic clean code
  principles. This will be encouraged by forcing students to adhere to
  basics of clean code principles via constantly. (i.e. Proper indentation, proper naming). This will be done with the help of code reviews and
  mentioning this constantly in homework.

# How are you going to help us?

## How are TAs assigned to homeworks?

- In each homework, there will be 2 TAs assigned to it.
- TAs will be responsible for provding 2 questions for each homework.

## How are TAs assigned to homeworks?

| TA Name   | Homework No .|
|-----------|--------------|
| Mohammad Yavari  | 1 |
| Bahareh Kavosi   | 1 |
| Arian Abdollahi  | 2 |
| Erfan Ebrahimi   | 2 |
| Erfan Zare       | 3 |
| Milad Zarei      | 3 |
| Mohammad Yavari  | 4 |
| Bahareh Kavosi   | 4 |
| Arian Abdollahi  | 5 |
| Erfan Ebrahimi   | 5 |
| Erfan Zare       | 6 |
| Milad Zarei      | 6 |

There might be a homework No. 7, but we will see how it goes.

## What are homework subjects?

Link to last year's homework schedule:

[Homework Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LhCy16ZlhZ2mDeAHnkwQHay3Lf-wvyLZfjtr1pyG0qA/edit?usp=sharing)

**NOTE**: This is highly subject to change. Proffessor might change their
teaching pace and we might have to adjust the homeworks accordingly.

## What is expected from TAs?

- Provide clear and concise questions for assignments.
- Provide test cases for the questions given. (Edge cases included!)
- Provide answers to students' questions (This will happen way less
  if the question is clear and concise)
- Be on time! Try to provide your questions before the deadline!

# We are looking forward to a great semester!
