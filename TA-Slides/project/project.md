# How is this semester going to be different?

## What is the problem?

Students...

- Aren't prepared for the project tools/libraries before the project starts.
- Don't learn how to **read** and **understand** documentations.
- Students usually create useless projects that don't have any real-world application.

## How is the project going to be different?

- **Preparation**: Students will be prepared for the project tools/libraries before the project starts.
- The project specifications will be clear far earlier than the project starts. So that...
    - Libraries, tools, and technologies can be taught before the project starts.
    - Professor teaches the necessary topics before the project starts.
    - Possible problems can be discussed before the project starts.

# What kind of projects are we looking for?

## Examples

- A TUI application that helps students to manage their homeworks
- A TUI application that helps students manage their tasks

## Examples

# How are you going to help us?

## Roadmap

1. Decide on the project topic.
2. Decide on the project tools/libraries. (i.e. makefile, ncurses)
3. Decide on the project specifications.
4. Try to implement the project yourself. 
5. Decide if the project is needed to be separated into smaller phases.
6. Write a clean, concise, and clear project documentation.

## How can you help each other?

- **Have meetings periodically**: Have meetings with your teammates to discuss the project. (Set someone as the meeting leader) 
- **Have meetings goals**: Have a clear goal for each meeting. (i.e. Decide on the project topic)

## What is expected from TAs?

- **Meet the deadline**: TAs should meet the deadlines for the project. (i.e. Decide on the project topic on time)
- **Help students**: TAs should help students with their project. (i.e. Help students to decide on the project topic)
- **Grade the project**: TAs should grade the project after the project is finished. (i.e. Grade the project based on the project documentation)

# We are looking forward to a great semester!
